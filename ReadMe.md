This project explores the simulation of a geometric body re-entering from space into Earthâ€™s atmosphere. The goal is to track its position, velocity, and orientation while capturing the critical transition between the space environment and the atmospheric environment. In this transition zone, motion and aerodynamics become tightly coupled, making the problem both mathematically and physically challenging.
